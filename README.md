# MicroPython Display Driver for [WaveShare 2.9inch e-Paper Display (B)](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.9inch_e-Paper_Module_(B))
The library supports drawing lines, shapes, text and images.  All code is documented and there are 3 demo examples.

Sample XGLCD fonts are included in the fonts folder.  Additional fonts can generated from TTF fonts using a free utility called MikroElektronika [GLCD Font Creator](https://www.mikroe.com/glcd-font-creator).

There are sample images in raw bitmap format and monoHMSB format.  Iâ€™ve included a python app in the utils folder to convert images in common formats such as JPEG and PNG to monoHMSB.
